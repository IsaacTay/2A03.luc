# 2A03.luc
A 2A03 emulator implemented using [lucid](https://alchitry.com/lucid) for the Alchitry Au + Br + Io.

## Notes
Further implementation is suspended due to the lack of an Alchrity to test changes on.

## Usage
You will need [Alchitry Labs](https://alchitry.com/alchitry-labs) & [Xilinx Vivado](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html) to compile and load into the Alchrity Au.

## Features
- Basic 6502 instruction set support
- Debugging capabilities using the IO shield

## TODO
- The APU is currently non-functional
- This does not implement the PPU
